# Fluminus App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/le0tan/randomword_app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/le0tan/randomword_app)

Actually I'm not sure how to name this project... Since we're using [Fluminus](https://github.com/indocomsoft/fluminus) to get information from [LumiNUS](https://luminus.nus.edu.sg/), Fluminus App it is, for now!
